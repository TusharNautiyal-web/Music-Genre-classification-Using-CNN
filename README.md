# Music-Genre-classification-Using-CNN
 Being an audio engineer myself i used my domain knowledge to analyse audio signal features and preprocess audio data.. We use **GTZAN** Dataset which is a very popular dataset for Audio Classification and trained a CNN model for outcome we also tried ANN but it was not giving good accuracy so we went ahead with CNN for this project. This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, The Uploaded sample of audio file should be of less then **30sec** and **.WAV** format for best results try to provide sections that have the most **elemental** or **instrumental ensemble** and should be of 30sec. If you want to test the model select ***Untrained Samples***. The model right now support only 10 genre which are blues, jazz, rock, metal, country, reagge, hiphop, pop, disco.
