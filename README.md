# Music-Genre-classification-Using-CNN

<a href= '#'>**Check Deployment**</a>

# Description
Being an audio engineer myself i used my domain knowledge to analyse audio signal features and preprocess audio data. We use **GTZAN** Dataset which is a very popular dataset for Audio Classification and trained a CNN model I also tried ANN but it was not giving good accuracy so i went ahead with CNN for this project. This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

# How to check deployment

You can see the deployed project here <a href = '#'>**Check Deployment**</a> or if you want to use this code in your ***local machine***, install requirements using requirements.txt after that use this command when u are inside your directory of repository.

```
streamlit run app.py
```
# Demonstration Video


# Important Points to keep in mind for checking
The Uploaded sample of audio file should be of less then **30sec** and **.WAV** format for best results try to provide sections that have the most **elemental** or **instrumental ensemble** and should be of 30sec. If you want to test the model select ***Untrained Samples***. The model right now support only 10 genre which are blues, jazz, rock, metal, country, reagge, hiphop, pop, disco.
